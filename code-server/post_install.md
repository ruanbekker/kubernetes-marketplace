### HTTPS

An ingress is automatically created during the application install. A certificate using cert manager and letsencrypt is also applied automatically and registered against your Civo email address and the generated domain name.

### Post installation

Once you have installed this app you will be able to connect to the web interface via https://coder.YOUR_CLUSTER_ID.k8s.civo.com
